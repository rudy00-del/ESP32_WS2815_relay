# 🌟 ESP32 Multi-Mode NeoPixel Animator

A fast, non-blocking **LED animation engine** for ESP32 built around the Adafruit NeoPixel library.  
Includes multiple effects such as **bouncing comets**, **smooth comets** — all switchable via a **web page** or in auto mode with time triggers.

Designed for **large LED strip projects (300+ LEDs)** with smooth animations and minimal CPU load.

## ✨ Features

- 🟦 **Mode 1 – Bouncing Comets**  
  Colorful comets bounce off the strip edges and change color after random rebounds.

- 🟧 **Mode 2 – Streaming Comets**  
  Smooth one-direction comets with randomized speeds and respawn behavior.

- 🔁 **Hardware Switching**  
  Relay switches on/off 12V power supply (led strip works on the evenings)

- ⚡ **Fully Non-Blocking Engine**  
  Zero delays — all timing uses `millis()` for perfect smoothness.

- 🧩 **Modular Code Design**  
  Each mode is in its own function (`mode1()`, `mode2()`, `mode6()`), easy to extend.
